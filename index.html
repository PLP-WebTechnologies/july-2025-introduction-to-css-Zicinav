                <p>
                    Sage is a playful Great Dane with a heart as big as his paws.  
                    Even though he is a giant, he is still a puppy at heart, always eager to run, play, and make new friends.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    He loves cuddles, long walks, and chasing after squeaky toys.  
                    His gentle nature makes him a beloved companion, and his goofy antics bring joy to everyone around him.
